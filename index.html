	<p>Simphiwe Sphesihle Phungwayo is an impatience person, this means that whenever I have maybe something I want to build or programm I get started on it right 	away, I don't wait for tommorow or any other day; I love spending time with my friends when I'm not busy or when I can't seem to find a solution to what I'm 	programming this helps me to refresh my mind. I am a shy person but I know how to communicate with people.</p>

	<p>I am a highly skilled person when it comes to programming and fixing broken things like door handles, kettles, heaters, cars e.t.c. There are a number of 	various other things that I like to do when I'm not programming or teaching myself other programming languages like HTML and CSS which is what I am currently 	focusing on right now. The thing that I am most passionated about is to become better at programming and be the greatest software engineer that can build 	anything from great websites to great systems.</p>

	<p>The things that I like to do with my spare time or should I say my hobbies are playing around with Microsoft Word, Excel and Database. I'm interested in 	computers that's why I spend most of my time on them and try to learn different technologies. What motivates me is to see the great things that other 	programmers have done and make their programs accessible to anyone who want them, that's what motivates me to build program that will improve peoples life.</p>
